# Virtual Loyalty App
So far, I have only created the app's base from which we can start working. For now, I have added all the screens to the app.js file so that you guys can understand the codes better. Moving forward we need to make individual files for the respective pages. I have also added some placeholder images that I alr had.

## üõ† How to Work on the Project as a Team

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch Before Making Changes**
To prevent merge conflicts, always create a new branch before coding:
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```
Example for adding a login screen:
```sh
git checkout -b login-screen-update
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Make & Save Changes**
Edit the code in **VS Code** or another text editor, then save your changes.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Commit & Push Changes**
After making changes, commit and push them:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added login screen UI"
git push origin login-screen-update
```
Then, create a **Pull Request (PR) on GitHub** to merge your changes.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Latest Changes (Before Working Again)**
Before starting new changes, always update your local copy:
```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
Then, create a new branch for the next feature:
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature
```
